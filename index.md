Welcome to the **Harvard Mathematics Departmental Group**.

We’re a student-led community in the Harvard Math Department focused on building connection, supporting each other, and making the department a fun and welcoming place to be.

Throughout the year, we host a wide range of events — from welcome gatherings and group birthday celebrations to fall outings, movie nights, and holiday parties. We also organize reading groups, problem sessions, and other chances to learn from each other in a relaxed setting.

Our goal is simple: help math students feel supported, included, and connected.
Whether you’re new to the department or have been here for years, you’re always welcome to join us.
