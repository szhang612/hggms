    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Harvard Mathematics Departmental Group</strong>!!</p>
    <p>We’re a student-led community in the Harvard Math Department focused on building connection, supporting each other, and making the department a fun and welcoming place to be.</p>
    <p>Throughout the year, we <strong>host a wide range of events</strong> — from welcome gatherings and group birthday celebrations to fall outings, movie nights, board game nights, and holiday parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Our goal is simple</strong>: help math students feel supported, included, and connected. Whether you’re new to the department or have been here for years, you’re always welcome to join us.</p>
    <p>Want to see what we’ve been up to? See our <a href="/past-events/">Past Events</a> for photos and highlights from previous activities, and check out our <a href="/schedule/">Schedule</a> for upcoming events!</p>
