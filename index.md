Welcome to the **Harvard Mathematics Departmental Group**.

We’re a student-led community in the Harvard Math Department focused on building connection, supporting each other, and making the department a fun and welcoming place to be.

Throughout the year, we host a wide range of events — from welcome gatherings and group birthday celebrations to fall outings, movie nights, board game nights, and holiday parties.

Our goal is simple: help math students feel supported, included, and connected. Whether you’re new to the department or have been here for years, you’re always welcome to join us.

Want to see what we’ve been up to? See our [Past Events](/past-events/) for photos and highlights from previous activities, and check out our [Schedule](/schedule/) for upcoming events!
